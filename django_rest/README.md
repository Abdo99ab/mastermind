## Endpoints
The main endpoint for the api will be */api/v1/*. All available endpoints are explained at */api/v1/docs*
```
/api/v1/docs # contains the API documentation generated by coreapi

/api/v1/games/
/api/v1/games/{id}/
/api/v1/games/{id}/guesses/

Here are the required endpoints description
```
1. Create a new game: POST /api/v1/games/
    Request body
        guess_limit: must be non null positive integer
2. Create a new guess: POST /api/v1/games/{game_pk}/guesses/
