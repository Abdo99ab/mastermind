# Mastermind Algorithm
# Given the secret sequence and a guess sequence, we can calculate the number of black pegs (The correct guesses in color and position) and the number of white pegs (The correct guesses in color only).
# We start by initializing b (black pegs) and w (white pegs) with 0.
# We create two tables to track down the positions already gone through for secret sequence and guess sequence.
# We start searching for the black pegs through one loop by incrementing b and adding both positions to the tracker if the color and position matches.
# After that, we search for white pegs through two loops, avoiding the positions already gone through by incrementing w and adding position to the tracker if the color matches
# Finally we return b and w.
